# Customer-Segmentation
A Simple Machine Learning Project
Customer segmentation using clustering techniques, such as K-Means, has gained popularity due to its ability to uncover hidden patterns in data.

Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning method, helps to automatically group customers based on data without predefined labels, making it ideal for exploring complex customer datasets.

This process allows businesses to create customer profiles that represent distinct needs and preferences, ultimately improving customer engagement and loyalty.
